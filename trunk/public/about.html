      Pulla is sweet-tasting bread, typically eaten with coffee, tea, hot chocolate or, in some cases, milk - and
      always in good company.

      <div id="box">
	Ingredients
	<ul>
	  <li>5 dl milk</li>
	  <li>50 g package yeast</li>
	  <li>950 g wheat flour</li>
	  <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
	  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	  <li>2 dl white sugar</li>
	  <li>200 g melted butter (unsalted)</li>
	  <li>1 egg for glaze, beaten</li>
	  <li>pearl sugar and/or almond slices for topping</li>
	</ul>
      </div>      
      <p>
	Warm milk to 40° C. In a large bowl, add yeast, salt, sugar
	and cardamom.
      </p>
      <p>
	Add half of the flour and knead until dough is stiff but not
	dry.
      </p>
      <p>
	Cover the bowl (e.g. with plastic-wrapping) and put in warm
	place. Allow the dough to rest for 15 minutes or until it has
	doubled in size..
      </p>
      <p>
	Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and
	knead until it is smooth and satiny, about 10 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
	Shape the dough into a ball. Place it in a lightly greased
	bowl, turn it around in the bowl to grease the top, and cover
	the bowl tightly with cling-film. Let the dough rise at room
	temperature until it doubles in bulk, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
      </p>
      <p>
	Line a large baking sheet with grease-proof paper and set aside.
      </p>
      <p>
	Turn the dough out onto the oiled surface and knead it lightly
	and briefly, just to deflate it and release the air. Divide
	the dough into small balls (Pullas) and put them on the baking sheet.
      </p>
      <p>
	Cover the Pullas with a kitchen towel and allow it to rise at
	room temperature until it is puffy but not doubled, about 45
	minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
	Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 200° C.
      </p>
      <p>
	Brush the egg glaze over the bread. Sprinkle the wreath with sliced almonds and pearl sugar.
      </p>
      <p>
	Bake for 12-15 minutes, until golden, taking care not to over bake. Transfer the Pullas to cool at room temperature before cutting.
      </p>
      <p>
	Storing:
	Pullas will keep for a day at room temperature, lightly covered with plastic. If you want to keep longer, wrap it air tight ans freeze it for up to 1 month. Thaw, still wrapped, at room temperature.
